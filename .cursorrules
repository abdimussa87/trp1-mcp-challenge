# Project Rules for Cursor Using Old Rules Approach

## Project Overview
This is the TRP 1 - MCP Setup Challenge workspace for demonstrating foundational qualities in configuring AI coding environments with MCP tools and rules.

## Tech Stack
- Primary IDE: Windsurf (AI-powered code editor)
- MCP Server: Tenx MCP (for logging interactions)
- Language: Markdown (documentation)
- Environment: macOS

## How I Work

### Communication Style
- Be terse and direct. Deliver fact-based progress updates.
- Use bullet points and short paragraphs instead of long blocks of text.
- Refer to me in second person, yourself in first person.
- No acknowledgment phrases (e.g., "Great idea!", "I agree").
- Jump straight into addressing requests without preamble.

### Code Style & Conventions
- Add all necessary imports at the top of files.
- Never add or delete comments unless explicitly asked.
- Use modern, idiomatic code patterns.
- Prefer minimal, focused edits over large refactors.
- Keep changes scoped and general-purpose.

### Making Code Changes
- Use edit tools for changes, never output code unless requested.
- Code must be immediately runnable.
- For very large edits (>300 lines), break into multiple smaller edits.
- Use absolute file paths for all file references.

### Task Management
- Use todo list to track multi-step work.
- Keep plans concise with one step in progress at a time.
- Update plans when new constraints or discoveries emerge.
- Only create notes/artifacts when they prevent rework.

### Running Commands
- Never use cd in commands. Specify directory via cwd parameter.
- Check for existing dev servers before starting new ones.
- Be careful with destructive operations.
- Never auto-run unsafe commands.

### Debugging Approach
- Address root cause, not symptoms.
- Add descriptive logging and error messages.
- Create test functions to isolate problems.
- Only make changes when certain of the solution.

### Documentation
- Never create .md documents unless explicitly asked.
- When documenting, use proper Markdown formatting.
- Use single backticks for code, fenced blocks for snippets.
- Bold critical information, use proper section headings.

## What I Expect From You

### Exploration
- Explore the codebase before making changes.
- Use code_search for broad exploration tasks.
- Use grep_search for targeted searches.
- Verify assumptions with tools before proceeding.

### Verification
- Always verify relevance of IDE metadata before assuming connection.
- Test changes thoroughly before marking complete.
- Provide copy-pastable commands when verification tools unavailable.

### Safety
- Respect workspace boundaries - don't create clutter.
- Check file existence before writing (use write_to_file only for new files).
- Never modify files without reading them first.

### Quality
- Make absolutely no ungrounded assertions.
- When uncertain, use tools to gather information.
- Provide context when uncertain about requirements.

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Task
1. Read relevant files to understand context
2. Create/update todo list if multi-step
3. Use code_search for exploration if needed
4. Implement minimal, focused changes
5. Verify and test thoroughly

### Handling Bugs
1. Identify root cause through investigation
2. Add targeted logging if needed
3. Implement minimal fix
4. Add regression tests
5. Verify fix resolves issue

### Research Tasks
1. Use web search tools for external information
2. Synthesize findings concisely
3. Apply relevant insights to the task
4. Document key learnings if valuable

## MCP Tools Available
- exa: Web search and code context search
- code_search: Parallel codebase exploration
- grep_search: Targeted code searching
- edit/multi_edit: File modifications
- run_command: Terminal operations
- Various file operations (read, write, list, find)

## Key Principles
1. **Minimal changes**: Smallest effective fix
2. **Verification first**: Test before assuming
3. **Context awareness**: Understand before acting
4. **Safety first**: Never auto-run unsafe commands
5. **Clear communication**: Direct, factual responses
6. **Tool mastery**: Use appropriate tools for each task

## When to Ask for Help
- When genuinely uncertain about intent or requirements
- When task requires user approval for destructive operations
- When multiple valid approaches exist and user preference unclear
- When encountering unexpected errors that need investigation

## Success Criteria
- Code works as intended
- Changes are minimal and focused
- No unnecessary files created
- Proper documentation when requested
- All tests pass (if applicable)
